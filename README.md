# Object Detection WebUI

The aim of this project is to streamline the training and validation process of creating new object detection models with the use of an intuitive web interface. Train, test, and check model parameters using this tool.


## Features

- [ ] Training Object Detection Model:
  - Users can train object detection models using custom datasets and predefined architectures.
  - Options for configuring training parameters such as batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs.

- [ ] Testing for mAP:
  - Evaluate the performance of trained models by calculating mAP on test datasets.
  - View detailed metrics and visualizations to assess model accuracy.

- [ ] Preparing Dataset:
  - Upload and preprocess image datasets for training and testing object detection models.
  - Annotation tools for labeling objects within images, supporting various annotation formats.

- [ ] Checking Model Parameters:
  - Visualize and adjust model parameters such as quantization, input size, and architecture.
  - Compare performance metrics for models with different configurations.

## Getting Started (Placeholder, will be replaced once the project gets rolling) 

To get started with the Object Detection WebUI, follow these steps:
